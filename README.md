### Hi!
This is Juana, my custom-made personal assistant. This is a project I have been working on in my
free time and I continue to work on. I started this as a personal project just to automatize part 
of my activities, but as of now I plan to grow it so that you can do more stuff with it everyday.
Each week I add a new functionality, or a new bug-fix, or grow it in some way.  

It is important to note that I tested everything in this app on my personal computer,
so you shouldn't be worried that something bad is going to happen. However, as I am just as CS
student and learning on the way, a bug might have slipped through my fingers. 
Don't get mad at it if it doesn't work the first time, I am improving it every week and please
don't hesitate to [tell me](mailto:pablo_blancoc@outlook.es) if you have a new idea or a bug is bothering you.  

## How does Juana work?
 This app you might be downloading is just a client that runs queries based on the phrase you say
 to it. The actual part where the processing is made is run on a Heroku server for now. So the part
 you are downloading is just a requests app, where each phrase contacts the server on a specific 
 endpoint and then the server answers back the phrase that your computer needs to answer.
 
## What can I ask Juana?
* What day is today
* Search on Wikipedia
* Define a word
* Get Mexico's City time

This are the things that are available for everyone. However, some of the things that I have 
implemented I have linked them with my personal accounts so that only I can use them. This include, 
but are not limited to creating a new appointment in the calendar, getting the weather at my hometown, etc.

The reason I have not implemented them for everyone is that I don't have much time to work on this project,
and I wanted something I could use, as that's the reason I started working on it. However, if you have 
any cool idea that you'd like me to try and implement it please let me know.

Juana is available as an app for macOS as that's the system I work on, so I didn't have an easy way
to test it on a Windows computer.

### Final notes:
Juana is like a baby to me. I had a great time coding it and still have. I hope, if you get to use
it, that you enjoy it the same way I do.
